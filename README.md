enmeaten
==================

You give it a bone line, and it fleshes it out. The bone line is just a series of points in order. The function returns control points that can be used to draw a line around the bone using Bezi√©r curves or your line interpolation method of choice. (The examples linked below use various forms of [d3-line](https://github.com/d3/d3-line).)

Installation
------------

    npm install enmeaten

Usage
-----

    var Enmeaten = require('enmeaten');
    var enmeaten = Enmeaten();
    
    console.log(enmeaten({
      bone: [
        [30, 50],
        [0, 20],
        [10, -10]
      ],
      forkLengthRange: [10, 25]
    }));

Output:

    [
      [ 60, 45 ],
      [ 29.19746968403191, 13.107412383579167 ],
      [ 38, -30 ],
      [ -13, -28 ],
      [ -29.19746968403191, 26.892587616420833 ],
