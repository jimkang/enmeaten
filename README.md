enmeaten
==================

You give it a bone line, and it fleshes it out. The bone line is just a series of points in order. The function returns control points that can be used to draw a line around the bone using Bezi√©r curves or your line interpolation method of choice. (The examples linked below use various forms of [d3-line](https://github.com/d3/d3-line).)

Installation
------------

    npm install enmeaten

Usage
-----

    var Enmeaten = require('enmeaten');
    var enmeaten = Enmeaten({
      numberOfDecimalsToConsider: 4
    });
    
    console.log(enmeaten({
      bone: [
        [30, 50],
        [0, 20],
        [10, -10]
      ],
      forkLengthRange: [10, 25]
    }));

Output:

    [
      [ 60, 45 ],
      [ 29.19746968403191, 13.107412383579167 ],
      [ 38, -30 ],
      [ -13, -28 ],
      [ -29.19746968403191, 26.892587616420833 ],
      [ 33, 80 ]
    ]

You can also provide an `extraRoundness` opt (a number) to make it that much meatier in the middle of the bone. 

`symmetricalEnds` will make the ends of the meat symmetrical along the axis of the bone.
`wideEnds` will make the ends of the meat wide, rather than narrow.
`widthInterpolator` is a function you provide to alter the width at the "elbows" of the bone. The function signature is ({ width, start, elbow, end, endToEndDistance }), where `width` is the width it was planning to use at the elbow. `endToEndDistance` is the total length of the bone. The other three opts are [x, y] values of the bend it is currently working on. enmeaten expects the interpolator to return a new width.

When creating an Enmeaten instance, the following opts can be specified:

  - `random`: A function that behaves like `Math.random`. You can substitute one created by [seedrandom](https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom) or something you've written yourself. Helps with situations in which you want reproducible results.
  - `numberOfDecimalsToConsider`: A positive number that tells it how precise to be when picking numbers in a range. If it encounters a range of 0.001, by default, it will always pick 0. (If the range is 100, it'll pick a whole number between 0 and 99.) If you specify 3 as `numberOfDecimalsToConsider`, it can pick numbers like 0.003 and 0.995. Useful for working for points that are really close together.

Tests
-----

Run tests with `make test`.

Tests and tools require Node 6. Module itself should work in all versions of Node and modern browsers.
